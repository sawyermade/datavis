# Project 5 Daniel Sawyer

## NOTE:
Iris and srsataact are the two main datasets for this project. Iris also is color coded to the type in col 5. All included datasets work as well.

Works with all data sets included, but Ketchup.csv is really slow/laggy along with a couple others. The others just arent as bad, so when changing axes long click the buttons. ie hold the mouse button down for a second or two over the next buttons.

Also, if you hover over the axes, a popup will display the value. This also works on all datasets included but is laggy for ketchup so you must let it hover over for longer before it pops up.
