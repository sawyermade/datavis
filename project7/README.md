# Project 7 Data Visualization Daniel Sawyer

## Data Sets
Works with both Iris.csv and srsatact.csv.

## Interaction
1. Mouse clicking one of the small scatter plots in the scatter matrix shows it in the larger window.

2. Hovering the mouse over one of the data points, in all of them except histograms and heatmap, highlights that row in all others.

3. The plus and minus buttons cycle through the columns in line plot.

## Colors
1. Blue is used for regular data points/lines.

2. Red is used for the highlighted point/line for linked views.

3. Histogram: blue is the bucket containing mean, green is mean +/- standard deviation, red is highlighted bucket.
