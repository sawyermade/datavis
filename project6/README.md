# Project 6 Data Visualization Daniel Sawyer

## Data Sets
Works with both Iris.csv and srsatact.csv.

## Interaction
1. Mouse clicking one of the small scatter plots in the scatter matrix shows it in the larger window.

2. Hovering the mouse over the parallel axes will highlight the whole line in red.

3. Hovering the mouse over one of the data points, in all of them but the matrix and parallel, highlights that row in all others.

4. The plus and minus buttons cycle through the columns in bar, line, and parallel plots.

## Colors
1. Blue is used for regular data points/lines.

2. Red is used for the highlighted point/line for linked views.

3. Color was added to the parallel coordinate graph for the Iris.csv data set according to Iris Class column.
